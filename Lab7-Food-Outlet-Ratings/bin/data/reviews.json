There is outdoor space for people with dogs, but it's irresponsible of the coffee shop owner to allow dog owners inside when there is a designated space for them. This action goes against the cleaning protocols of a café and is inconsiderate of their customers who might choose to sit inside because they don't want to be around dogs!!"

The seating is also super crammed. I'm willing to compromise on the latter grievances but not the prices. I will be buying my coffee elsewhere."

        "comment": "In an unexpected twist, Surrey, BC has become home to a diner that marries Americana kitsch with Canadian culinary flair. The Waffle House Diner (no relation to the Southern U.S. chain) serves up nostalgia with a side of innovation.\n\nThe star of the show is their breakfast poutine, a morning riff on the Quebec classic. Crispy potato cubes replace the traditional fries, while a silky hollandaise stands in for gravy. Soft-boiled eggs crown this indulgent mess, their yolks mingling with squeaky melted cheese curds to create a sauce that's equal parts comforting and luxurious. It's the kind of dish that makes you question why you'd ever settle for plain old hash browns again, scrambled eggs, and bacon.\n\nThe coffee ($3, bottomless) is mercifully robust, a far cry from the watery swill often masquerading as diner java. It's the perfect foil to the rich poutine, cutting through the richness and providing that much-needed caffeine kick and diner\u2019s strength.  I no longer eat Whitespot for breakfast do to the fact that their pale watery bottomless coffee is $7! So $3 for a very decent cup of diner coffee.\n\nService comes with a smile, courtesy of a young staff that seems genuinely pleased to be there. The vibe is pure Vancouver\u2014effortlessly friendly without being cloying.\n\nThe space itself is a clever blend of retro and modern. Chrome and Formica abound, but there's breathing room between tables\u2014a luxury in diner terms. It's as if a 1950s greasy spoon got a makeover from a minimalist Scandinavian designer.\n\nWhile it may not reach the heights of culinary greatness, Waffle House Diner offers an above average solid breakfast experience with a uniquely West Coast Canadian twist. It's comfort food that doesn't take itself too seriously\u2014much like Surrey itself."

The sushi is also nice, but you need to visit the store in person as they're not available for delivery. We usually include one sushi roll, and they're always fresh and good.

I mean, the broth is great but you don't get a plate of bean sprouts and basil leaves like you do at other pho restaurants. I thought maybe at first, they forgot but my second time eating in, they forgot again. No one got it so that seems to be the norm. Service is prompt. Food is good. Also for big eaters, try to do an add-on. I added a lemongrass chicken to my pho and ended up bringing home 2 large pieces of grilled chicken for dinner. The servings are plentiful. Meat balls can be a little more plump, quail eggs in a seafood soup?? Music is a bit rad for this place too but catered to students, it's understandable."

I can cook Pho at home and am 🇻🇳 but I approve the taste of Pho here, it\u2019s decent and better than many places outside of Vietnam. Someone just complained about the fatty beef slices in the Pho they ordered, so i guess many people don\u2019t understand there\u2019re different types of beef you can order for Pho, get the sirloin cut (rare beef) one and it will be lean and soft. I like the beef broth, very southern style Pho of 🇻🇳.\n\nService was good, they\u2019re just students working part-time and attentive, i had no problem.\n\nThe fact that they offered free extra broth and noodles is a plus. I never could finish a bowl of Pho there, so the portion is good. Maybe lower the price and put a smaller size in the menu. Chili sauce there is authentic (though siracha is not authentic sauce for Pho, and chili sauce in general for 🇻🇳)\n\nIt\u2019s funny that looking at the pictures of the bad reviews made me crave for a Pho here so gonna order one now. You guys took pretty good pictures lol\n\nKeep in mind that not only this place, Pho restaurants outside of Vietnam don\u2019t want to make it super authentic because they need to please 1001 tastes of nationality."

Unlike other times, I came with my husband for dinner this time.\n\nWe are well aware that their portion is quite big, so we agreed to order some food to share. Taiwanese style pork knuckle, fried rice noodles with veggie and shredded pork and a soup with meat balls.\n\nThe pork knuckle is so so. It's quite tender but the flavor is rather mild. Perhaps that's the whole point of having a sauce with it. The sauce did enhance the flavor and made the pork knuckles more enticing. Among the food we ordered, my favorite is the fried rice noodle. It might look very plain and not that appealing in photo, but its very aromatic and flavorful. The magic came from the dried shrimps. They totally took the dish to a different level. The soup tasted like what it supposed to be. No surprise, bad or good.\n\nMyst is one of the restaurants that you can go for a late night meal coz it closes around midnight from Sunday to Thursday. On Friday and Saturday, it extends the hours to about 12:30am. Its menu offers you a great variety of food, bubble tea and desserts."

The portion sizes of all the dishes were quite large and we had leftovers to take home. My favourite dish was the chicken red curry.

I wait, & after 25 minutes pass watching the person who took my order have a conversation with another staff in the kitchen, I get up & start to hover at the counter. I guess they noticed, because I saw only then, did they start cooking my order. There's no ketchup available, so I asked for some. The lady seemed confused, then insited they keep it behind the counter. Finally after waiting another 20 minutes, I'm given my burger with smallest amount of ketchup possible, after this lady had sassed me about literally, 3 drips of water which fell from my fountain drink after pouring myself water. I didn't bother to try to ask for more kerchup I wanted. Bottom line, do not go here, unless you want horrendously slow & rude service."
